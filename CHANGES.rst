Version 0.7.0
-------------

To be released.

- ``nirum.rpc`` module and ``Client``, ``Service``, and ``WsgiApp`` in
  the module, had been deprecated since 0.6.0, are now completely obsolete.
- Annotation parameters (``service_annotations``, ``method_annotations``, and
  ``parameter_annotations``) of ``nirum.transport.Transport.call()`` method
  now can take multiple arguments.
- Since Nirum compiler became to give ``__nirum_type__`` attribute to
  every generated classes (see also the `pull request`__),
  ``nirum.deserialize.deserialize_meta()`` function also became to leverage
  it if present.
- Since Nirum compiler became to give ``__nirum_tag_classes__`` mapping to
  every generated union classes (see also the `pull request`__),
  ``nirum.deserialize.deserialize_union_type()`` function also became to
  lerverage it if present.
- Removed unmaintained below codes. Now these will be generated by Nirum, 
  automatically.

  [`#110`_]


Version 0.6.2
-------------

Released on February 11, 2018.

Version 0.6.1
-------------

Released on December 9, 2017.

- Made ``nirum.datastructures.List`` to copy the given value so that
  it doesn't refer given value's state and is immutable.


Version 0.6.0
-------------

Released on July 11, 2017.

- Deprecated ``nirum.rpc`` module.

  This module and all it has provided are deprecated or obsolete.  The most
  of them are now distributed as separated packages, or replaced by a newer
  concept.  See also the below for details.

  It will be completely obsolete at version 0.7.0.

- Client transport layer.  [`#79`_]

  - Added ``nirum.transport.Transport`` interface.

    The recent builds of Nirum compiler became to generate ``*_Client`` classes
    taking a ``nirum.transport.Transport`` instance through their constructor.

    Use nirum-python-http_ (PyPI handle: ``nirum-http``) instead for HTTP
    client of services e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python

       from yourservice import YourService_Client
       from nirum_http import HttpTransport

       transport = HttpTransport('https://service-host/')
       client = YourService_Client(transport)

  - Deprecated ``nirum.rpc.Client`` type.  The recent builds of Nirum compiler
    became to generate ``*_Client`` classes for services without subclassing
    ``nirum.rpc.Client``.

    The deprecated ``nirum.rpc.Client`` will be completely obsolete at
    version 0.7.0.

- ``nirum.rpc.Service`` was moved to ``nirum.service.Service``.

  The recent builds of Nirum compiler became to generate service classes
  that inherit ``nirum.service.Service`` instead of ``nirum.rpc.Service``.

  The deprecated ``nirum.rpc.Service`` will be completely obsolete at
  version 0.7.0.

- Deprecated ``nirum.rpc.WsgiApp``.  This will be completely obsolete at
  version 0.7.0.

  Use nirum-python-wsgi_ (PyPI handle: ``nirum-wsgi``) instead.

- ``nirum-server`` command is obsolete.  The same command is now provided
  by nirum-python-wsgi_ (PyPI handle: ``nirum-wsgi``), a separated package.

- ``nirum.func.import_string()`` function and ``nirum.func.IMPORT_RE`` constant
  are obsolete.

- Fixed ``NameError`` raised from forward references.  [`compiler #138`_]

Version 0.5.6
-------------

Released on April 5, 2018.

- Fixed a bug that ``hash()`` on ``nirum.datastructures.List`` had raised
  ``TypeError``.


Version 0.5.5
-------------

Released on April 5, 2018.

- Added missing equality functions (i.e., ``==``, ``!=`` operators, & ``hash()``
  function) to ``nirum.datastructures.Map`` and ``nirum.datastructures.List``.
  [`#110`_]

Version 0.5.4
-------------

Released on December 9, 2017.

- Made ``nirum.datastructures.List`` to copy the given value so that
  it doesn't refer given value's state and is immutable.


Version 0.5.3
-------------

Released on July 6, 2017.

- Fixed a serialization bug that other set-like (i.e. ``collections.Set``) types
  than Python built-in ``set`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so that they
  can be encoded to JSON.
- Fixed a serialization bug that other list-like (i.e. ``collections.Sequence``)
  types than Python built-in ``list`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so
  that they can be encoded to JSON.


Version 0.5.2
-------------

Released on June 23, 2017.

- ``url`` of ``nirum.rpc.Client`` and
  ``method`` of ``nirum.rpc.Client.make_request``
  now can be both ``unicode`` and ``str`` on Python 2.7. [`#87`_]
- ``nirum.rpc.Client`` had been an old-style class on Python 2, but now
  it became a new-style class also on Python 2. (As Python 3 has only new-style
  class, there's no change on Python 3.)

.. _#87: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum-python/pull/87


Version 0.5.1
-------------

Released on June 22, 2017.

- Added Python 3.6 support.
- Fixed a bug that service client methods hadn't raised the proper error
  type but ``nirum.exc.UnexpectedNirumResponseError`` instead.  [`#71`_]
- Wheel distributions (``nirum-*.whl``) are now universal between Python 2
  and 3.  [`#78`_]
- ``nirum.rpc.Service`` had been an old-style class on Python 2, but now
  it became a new-style class also on Python 2.  (As Python 3 has only new-style
  class, there's no change on Python 3.)  [`#83`_]
- ``nirum.rpc.Client`` and its subtype became to raise ``TypeError`` with
  a better error message when its ``make_request()`` method is overridden and
  it returns a wrong artity of tuple.  [`#80`_]
- ``nirum.rpc.WsgiApp`` and its subtype became to raise ``TypeError`` with
  a better error message when its ``make_response()`` method is overridden and
  it returns a wrong artity of tuple.  [`#80`_]
- Fixed a bug that ``Client.ping()`` method had always raised ``TypeError``.
  [`#80`_]
- Corrected a typo ``Accepts`` on request headers ``Client`` makes to
  ``Accept``.

  types than Python built-in ``list`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so
  that they can be encoded to JSON.

  specification`__.  [`#66`_]

  which is an immutable dictionary.  [`#66`_]

  [`#49`_]
